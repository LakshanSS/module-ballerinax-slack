This is a [Ballerina](https://ballerina.io/) connector for Slack.

[Slack](https://api.slack.com/) is a channel-based messaging platform. With Slack, people can work together more effectively, connect all their software tools and services, and find the information they need to do their best work â€” all within a secure, enterprise-grade environment.

This connector allows you to access the Slack Web API and Slack Events API through Ballerina. This 
connector can be used to implement some of the most common use cases of Slack. This connector provides the capability
to query information from and perform some actions in a Slack workspace. This connector also allows you to listen to
Slack Events.
